# microlaunch-nogui
A FINAL FANTASY XIV Online native launcher for Linux.
This branch does not have a GUI, because [iced pinned a broken version of WebGPU](https://twitter.com/lostkagamine/status/1641934661566840833).

## Why?
XIVLauncher doesn't work for my incredibly fringe use-case.

## Who is this for?
[Myself](https://kagamine-r.in).

## How to compile?
See [BUILDING.md](/BUILDING.md).

## How do you use it?
See [USAGE.md](/USAGE.md).  
*DISCLAIMER: Documentation, as well as the tool in general, is an extreme work in progress.*
